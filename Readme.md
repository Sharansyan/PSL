## Abstract
A reinforced concrete building in Konya, Turkey, collapsed suddenly on February 2, 2004, and 92 residents died. The essence of a forensic engineering investigation of a construction failure is to determine the failure mechanisms by using the procedural causes and contributing factors. The building behavior under the sudden loss of ground-story columns and various scenarios of column removal was assessed. The lessons learned from this case study forensic investigation are discussed, and the construction and project errors beneath the collapse are identified. Torsion is not the desired first mode of dynamic behavior. The progressive collapse of the RC building was the torsional mode. In building due to architectural needs, i.e., lack of the beam in exterior frames, discontinuities in the three-dimensional (3D) structural framing and very low bonds existed in the RC beams, resulting in an improper redistribution of the forces.

## 1.	Introduction
Forensic engineering is a field of engineering that involves investigating and analyzing failures or accidents in order to determine their root causes. It applies scientific principles and methods to evaluate the performance of structures, systems, and components in a variety of industries, including construction, transportation, and manufacturing. Forensic engineers use a combination of technical knowledge, analytical skills, and investigative techniques to identify the causes of failures and provide recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future. Or Forensic engineering is the execution of engineering principles in the investigation of damage or various structural performance problems.
The essential problems of an event to consider are.
1)	What is the damage or conditions of concern?
2)	What is the severity and measure of the damage?
3)	when did it happen (if this is needed); and
4)	Why did the failures of concern happen?
Several cases have been found where buildings collapse in different Loads at different conditions.
1)	Dostlar Apartment Building, Konya, Turkey, which was damaged under its own weight.
2)	Some examples of sudden collapse of buildings under gravitational loads throughout Turkey include the Diyarbakir Hicret Apartments (January 4, 1983), where 93 residents died, Çavdar Apartments in Eskisehir (May 4, 1985),

## 2.	About the structure (Zumrat Building)
The case investigated in this study is the Zumrut Residential Apartment Building. It was constructed in 1994. The 11-story reinforced concrete building was located in the Selcuklu area of Konya, Turkey (Figure 1a). 
At the time, the building site was located in a no seismic zone according to then-current seismic code (TEC 1975) at the time of construction, and the structural design was performed under gravity loads and wind loads only. The building survived just 5 years after the completion of construction.
Progressive collapse of the building under gravity loads caused a sudden and total collapse on February 2, 2004 (Figure 1b)

## 3.	Investigation
Detailed field notes, photos, and videos are valuable for documentation of the collapsed shape and the removal procedure. Also, aerial photos may supply an invaluable overall view of the debris site. The collapsed configuration of the building is shown in Figure 2. The collapse pattern can supply precious data about feasible collapse mechanisms and the source of the damage.

### 3.1.	Testing
Concrete strength was lower than the design assumptions and code requirements for a reinforced concrete building. Many samples were taken onsite after the collapse of the building to determine the concrete quality used in the construction. It can be recommended to test given specimens instantly to establish the concrete strength on the event day. 
The approved design compressive strength for the reinforced concrete was 14 MPa. It is the minimum concrete strength used in the design at that time. Test results of concrete cylinders taken from the site revealed a compressive strength of 8 MPa. Based on material testing and site investigations, it was observed that the concrete gradation in the Zumrut Building was not uniform. The gradation did not satisfy Turkish standards [TBC-500 (TBC 1984); TS 500 (TS 2000)].

### 3.2.	Inspection of Members
Figure 2 shows the field examination of the disaster area including insufficient concrete quality and poor reinforcement detail from the column components that remained.
•	Stirrup spacing, reinforcement cover, and replacements also did not comply with code requirements.
•	Using plain (smooth) reinforcements was another weak side of structural components due to lack of bonding between steel rebars and concrete.
•	Reinforcement types were found to be of the ST I type (220 MPa). Stirrups were not increased near the beam–column connection regions. 
•	Reinforcement cover varied significantly. It was found to be 5 cm in some columns. This small concrete beam sections, as well as the use of reinforcement type ST I (220 MPa) instead of ST III (420 MPa), resulted in a large number of reinforcements in the beam design.

It was observed from the collapsed building that the ground-story level (consisting of shops) and roof level were constructed as ribbed slabs of 32 cm rather than reinforced concrete slabs of 12 cm, as shown in the approved structural drawings. The ribbed slabs were approximately two times heavier than the 12 cm reinforced concrete slab. During the removal of debris, a column of variable dimensions was also found at the ground story.

## 4.	3D model
The Zumrut Building was modeled using the analysis program ETABS (version 8.17) to check the existing structural project and design calculations (Figure 3). When the project was prepared, Konya was not considered as an earthquake region according to the current Turkish Earthquake Code (TEC 1975). For this reason, only vertical gravity loads (dead and live loads) and additional lateral loads (wind loads and their combinations) were considered in the design stage and control of the RC building design computations.
The 11-story Zumrut Building was approximately 36 m high. The ground story was 5.6 m high to accommodate shops, and the residential floors were 3 m high. Columns dimensions were generally 20/100, 20/70, and 25/100 cm (25/70 cm at the basement and ground-story levels). Beam dimensions were generally 20/50 cm. Reinforced concrete slabs were 12 cm.

There are no supports between the columns that surround the building's exterior. This might be as a result of the architectural perspectives depicted in Figure 4. Therefore, the absence of beams in the frame axis rendered the frames inoperative. The beams were situated at the plan's exterior perimeter and were cantilevered from the frame columns. Additionally, as a consequence of this, the exterior frame column was exposed to significant impacts of console load at the out-of-frame elevation. Corner sections were especially important. When the stability of the building altered, the outer portions of the building frames were unable to transfer the loads efficiently under lateral loads. As a result, the building's torsional resistance was very minimal.
For example, the project designers used higher allowable concrete stresses for the concrete by considering the critical load case as the combination of gravity loads plus lateral wind forces, which resulted in the selection of small column and beam dimensions. However, when considering the primary gravity loads, it was observed that this resulted in large structural sections in this load case. All combinations must be considered in structural design. In particular, basement and ground-story column dimensions must be 25%–45% larger than the project calculations.

## 5.	Conclusion
The progressive collapse analysis showed that the collapse mode of the building was a torsional mode. Possible local failure mechanisms would cause a progressive failure of the base-story columns due to excessive loading from neighboring structural members. Such a story collapse resulted in a torsional mechanism mode. 
The collapse analysis revealed that.
•	A column was crushed.
•	Then the neighboring column was subjected to additional loads of 20% initial loads.
•	Because most of the columns were near capacity limits due to project and construction errors and low-quality concrete, the additional loads lead to column failure and in turn the progressive collapse of adjacent columns. 
•	The torsional capacity of the building was very low.
•	As result, the collapse of story level occurred, then progressive collapse of the upper stories and finally in total collapse of the Zumrut Building.
